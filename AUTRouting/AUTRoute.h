/// Defines a route and the handler that is invoked when routing occurs.
///
/// A route consists of one or more string path components that are
/// matched against the path components of a URL.
///
/// For example, the route path components to match the URL
/// "custom:/country/state/city/" would be the following array of path
/// components: [ "country", "state", "city" ].
///
/// Route path components may contain tokenized strings that represent a dynamic
/// path component. Dynamic components are denoted by a leading colon, e.g.
/// ":user_id".
///
/// For example, the route [ "user", ":user_id" ] would match the URL
/// "custom:/user/1234/", where "1234" would be the value for the "user_id" key
/// passed into the handler block.
///
/// Routes may also require a context object that contains additional data that
/// is not encoded into the URL as a string. If a context object is required to
/// handle a specific route, it can be specified when building a route. The
/// handler will not be invoked unless a context object of the provided class is
/// present.
