/// an exception is thrown if it is invoked.
///
/// An example of its usefulness is with nibs. If marking initWithCoder: as
/// unavailable, it can still be invoked when the object is loaded from a nib.
/// By throwing an exception immediately upon invocation, we ensure failure
/// occurs as early as possible, rather than continuing with undefined behavior.
